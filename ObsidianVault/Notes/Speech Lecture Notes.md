friday when we are back from spring break we pick days to go for our speech. if you miss the day we get a 0.

2 weeks to prepare and pratice speech.

**FIND A TOPIC**

rubric is on bb

after research, start writing speech

#### Write intro and conclusion.
	elements of intro and conclusion that are needed can be found in the textbook and the rubric
	5 things that are required
	1. *Attention getter* - can be more than one sentance 
		video, story, don't do jokes **has to be first**
	2. (Reason to listen* - show audience how your topic is connected to them 
		why should the audience care? 
	3. *thesis statement* - 
		asads
	4. *credibility statement* - what makes you worth listening
		"I was interested in (topic) and I did some research"
	5. preview of main points
		**has to be last**
The two things you should know like the back of your hand should be the intro and the conclusion. Remember, confidence will make your speech more enjoyable and strong. 


#### Write the main points of the speech
Remember, you are following principles of formal outlining
Read outline from top to bottom out loud to make sure that it sounds *like* a speech

outline should be detailed enough that someone else could be able to present yout speech based on the outline

Full page of outline usually equated to 1-1:30 minute(s)

Balance of points - Each point should be talked about for similar amounts of time, spending a lot of time on one point but being lackluster on the others is not good

Write outline in complete sentances -
Each point has subpoints, then those subpoints can also have subpoints.

EX.
Important roman sites
	1. the collesuem
		- informtion about the collesuem
	1. the pantheon
		- information about the pantheon

Points cannot overlap, do not repeat information - 
(You did this in your powerpoint speech, bad move!)

The way you list items in the outline 
	2 like points are a must through out
		ex. 1.
				a.
			  2.
			    b.
Indent properly!
IT MUST LOOK NEAT!
Don't forget puncuation oh my god I cannot spell help me



#### Coordination & Subordination
 Main points should support the thesis
	 Subpoints should support the main points
		 subsubpoints should support the subpoints
			 and so on and so fourth...
Keep youself on topic. veering off will make you lose the attention of the audience
