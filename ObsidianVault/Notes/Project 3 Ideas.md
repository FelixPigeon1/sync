**Driving Question:** What draws me to photography

Object approach - Cameras
	Talk about the moments in my life involving cameras, various trips such as 8th grade DC, New York, or Guy's cabin. Mention Reed giving me his film camera, or My mom using the large format camera at home. 

Home approach - Old buildings disappearing, seeing change at home
	Think the Main theater being flattened in RO or Barnes & Nobel closing and being replaced with Buffalo Wild Wings. Seeing what has changed now at home versus what was or wasnt there say 10 years ago.

Object approach - Video game something (This is a major cop out)
	Discuss memories with games, playing halo 3 with my dad or even resident evil 4. How I have made friends online 

should I even use another topic related to cameras? Feels like I should do something more unique. I just put the video game one to get it out of my head but tbh I don't really care for it. I think I could do something pretty solid with the camera one, I think a neat way to look at it is im talking about captures of memories which feature capturing memories. Thinking about it this way makes it sound a lot more unique. 

Writing out my thoughts like this as a stream of consiousness is actually very relaxing. I should do this more often
