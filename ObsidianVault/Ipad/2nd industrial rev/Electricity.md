Thomas edison and the lightbulb
First issue - took a lot of current to shoot the energy between the two lamp posts
Lots of wasted energy, wasted coal
Incredibly bright, great for street lights, not good for homes - wasted energy becomes an issue for home lights
Solution? The incandescent lightbulb - Cheap, uses less energy, instrumental in the electrification of homes.
