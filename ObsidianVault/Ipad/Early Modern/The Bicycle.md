1700s
Dandy horse
Metal wheels, no chain, powered by legs only
Legs getting dirty from pushing the bike led to the 

1800s
Ariel or Ordinary or Penny Farthing was the solution
Made one big wheel and one small wheel so the rider was further off the ground
The creation of bicycle clubs
Gave buddies to ride bikes and a social group to share knowledge about bikes
1-1 pedal to wheel, people would ride “legs over” the handlebars to go faster down hill.
Women would ride Bikes and horses “Side saddle” as it was what was common place.
