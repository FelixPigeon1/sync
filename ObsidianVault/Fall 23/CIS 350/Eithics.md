Terac 6 and 20
1 of 6 accidents - Operator mistake 
2 of 6 - 

more readable user interface, maybe physical buttons 

no hardware interlocks or circuits for safeguards 

software error where the computer did not know if it was an underdose or overdose of radiation

switching to electron mode while currently switching to xray mode would cause the turn table to not move to the correct place, putting it into an unknown state

code had little comments and programmer was inexperienced, programmer could not be found as they no longer worked for the company

no timing analysis

too many hands involved with the issue, blame the operator? the inexperienced programmer? the engineers? 

lack of testing, safety features.

"In 1986, Ray Cox went into the clinic for his usual radiation treatment in his shoulder. The
technician mistakenly typed "x" into the computer, which signified x-ray beam, then immediately
realizing the error, changed the "x" into an "e" for electron beam, and hit "enter", showing the
machine that they were ready to start treatment. This sequence occurred in less than 8 seconds.
(This particular sequence, in this time frame, was never tried in the original testing of the
machine.) The computer gave the signal of "beam ready", and the technician pressed "b" to deliver
the beam to the patient. But then the computer responded with an error message. Usually this
message meant that the treatment had not been delivered. So the technician repeated the process
and delivered another beam to the patient. And yet again, an error message occurred. Meanwhile,
Ray felt sharp stabbing pains in his back, which was much different than his usual treatments, and
removed himself after three shocking attempts.
Because the commands were changed in such a short period of time, the computer did not
respond properly. The metal plate moved away showing the technician that it was in low energy
electron beam mode. But the beam that actually came from the machine was a blast of 25 000 rads
with 25 million electron volts, the maximum setting, which is more than 125 times the regular
dose."
