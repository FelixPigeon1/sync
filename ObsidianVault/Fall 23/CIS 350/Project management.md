## Object Oriented metrics
errors per KLOC (thousand lines of code)
defects per KLOC
$ per KLOC
pages of documentation per KLOC

object oriented metrics
number of scenario sctips
number of key classes
	highly independent
	shows amount of work required
number of support classes
	required for system but not problem domain
	database class EX
	amount of effort to develop the software

## Metrics for quality
Quality -> indirect

D = defects

### DRE = $\frac{E}{E + D}$

Get this as close to 1 as possible


>I need to go to cocomo!
## COCOMO I
Estimates effort (cost) as a function of project size
different size measures
	Loc object oriented
Basic
	just starting,
	can make changes at very minimal cost
intermediate
	making diagrams
	just started coding, not far along
advanced
	code is far along, deep in development
	lots of effort to make a change at this point
Organic
Semi detached 
	most startups
Embedded
	project that must be developed within a set of tight hardware, software, and operational constraints. 

Most critical path is the longest path, if it gets delayed the whole project gets delayed
other parts of the project can be delayed by a day or 2 with no major issues usually
