Set of Capabilities - What should it be able to do?
Set of Constraints - What should it not do?

Business Requirements - people who are actually paying
User Requirements - end users
Functional Requirements - What the dev's must include to meet Business and User requirements
Non-Functional Requirements - Never explicitly asked for, general goals

Inception  - The start of an idea
	A simple conversation, someone complains about an issue, you try to fix it
Elicitation - Establish goals
	Normal Requirements
		If these are present the customer is satisfied
	Expected Requirements
		So fundamental that the customer does not explicitly state them
	Exciting Requirements
		Very satisfying when present
	Identify User classes
		Domain experience
		computer system experience
		features they use
		tasks they perform
		access privilege or security levels


Quality over Quantity
Startups fail because of poor performance, not missing functionality
