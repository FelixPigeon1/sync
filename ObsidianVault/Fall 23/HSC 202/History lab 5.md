As President Dwight D Eisenhower gave his farewell address the United States were locked inside a cold war with the Soviet Union. This war is unique as it did not often cause direct firefights between each other but rather a race of technological innovations. It’s thanks to the cold war, for better or for worse, that we have a lot of the modern technology we use today such as satellites and advanced radio systems.
