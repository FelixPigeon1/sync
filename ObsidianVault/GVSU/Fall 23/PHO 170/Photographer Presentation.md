## Old Outline
### Intro
(something) I have gone on many road trips that went through the country. I remember looking out the window and seeing


Bernd and Hilla Becher were a couple from Germany who started with a very specific style and stuck with it for their active time in photography from 1959 to 2007. One unique aspect of their work was the use of large format film cameras. These cameras were able to capture immense depths of detail in their subjects used their artistic skills to highlight the architectural design of abandoned industrial locations.

### German Homes
Some of their early works focused on the architecture of German homes, showcasing the collection of straight lines that make up the walls of the house.

Where their work really shines is in the juxtaposition of the other photographs of similar subjects, you'll be seeing this throughout their works

### Water Towers
Most of their work is taken in black and white and I think this was a great creative decision as the lack of color allows you to focus on the shapes and lines of the structure. the blank white skies also help in this making sure that most of the dark colors are coming from the subject keeping you focused there as well.

### Blast furnaces


### Chemical Factories
I think this works evoke an almost nostalgic feeling. The emptiness some of these photographs display with the lack of color and people and expression

### Grain elevators


## Slide 1
*Introduce bernd and hilla becher*
"Today I will be showcasing the work of Bernd and hilla becher."
## Slide 2
*Give details of the background of the two*
"Bernd and hilla were both born in germany in the 1930s, they met at (NAME OF SCHOOL) and became partners in photography and married roughly 2 years after that. The couple were active from 1959 to 2007 when Hilla passed away.
One of the main features of their work is the use of large format film cameras. These cameras are able to capture immense amount of detail in their subjects.
Their main focus for their artwork was Architecture, mainly industrial architecture, and the details of form and function"
## Slide 3 - German houses
*introduce the first set of works, the german houses*
"One of their early works was a focus on the architecture of old rural German houses. The side of the house is front and center and fills the frame of the photo, making the viewer focus on the wooden frames of the house and the position of the windows against the frames. On its own the photos do a great job on showing the form on the subject but where they really stand out is when they are placed in a series. "

## Slide 4 - GH Series
*Explain the importance of their work in a series*
"here is a collection of 15 different German homes and now we are able to focus on not just one but the similarities and differences of all. Here is a quote from the two that explains this aspect."

>We deal with objects not motifs, the photograph serves as a stand-in for the object it is useless as a picture in the conventional sense. The information we wish to communicate arises only in the series, in the juxtaposition of objects, weather similar or dissimilar, that perform the same function.

"Their goal with their artwork was to focus on the many different "
## Slide 5 - Water tower
*Explain how the lack of color emphasizes shape*
"Most of their work is taken in black and white and I think this was a great creative decision as the lack of color allows you to focus on the shapes and lines of the structure. the blank white skies also help in this making sure that most of the dark colors are coming from the subject keeping you focused there as well."
## Slide 6 - WT Series

## Slide 7 & 8- Blast Furnace
*Explain how the artists isolate their subjects of the whole*
Another key aspect of their photographs are the way they are able to isolate their intended subject from the larger piece, these blast furnace photos are a great example of this practice in action. Each of these phots
>"We want to change nothing about the objects we photograph, and it is a principle we still adhere today. Only one artifice is permissible, namely to strip the individual objects of context, in other words to position then in such a way that they fill the frame."

"Bernd and hilla want these photos to be as unbiased as possible and this can be shown throughout their works."

## Slide 9 & 10- Chemical Plant
"These are my personal favorites, I love the how much detail is inside this photo, layers and layers as the shadows start to obscure the structure."
## Slide 11 & 12 &13- Grain Elevators
*Explain the isometric views that the artists tend to favor for their subjects*\
These last couple of photos show off how replicating the same framing for their photos allow it to be easliy compared to one another when placed together in a series.

## Conclusion
Bernd and hilla's work does a very unique job of capturing the subject without capturing anything else, no emotion, no context, and no story, just the form of the subject is all we the viewer have to take in. Their photographs document what is arguablly the most impact events in human history, the industrial revolution. To have a this record of both engineering innovation and architectural design is very important. 
>They wanted full detail in their negatives and prints because their work is a form of documentation that is also meant for the future, for future engineers. 

Extra note: Bernd and Hilla did some work inside the Unites States as well as they thought it would be important to capture the US side of the industrial story and in an interview with their son max he recounted that they had difficulty getting near the structures due to rampant crime or risk of getting arrested or shot by police.
