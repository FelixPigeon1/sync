## Intro
(something) I have gone on many road trips that went through the country. I remember looking out the window and seeing


Bernd and Hilla Becher were a couple from Germany who started with a very specific style and stuck with it for their active time in photography from 1959 to 2007. One unique aspect of their work was the use of large format film cameras. These cameras were able to capture immense depths of detail in their subjects used their artistic skills to highlight the architectural design of abandoned industrial locations.

## German Homes
Some of their early works focused on the architecture of German homes, showcasing the collection of straight lines that make up the walls of the house.

Where their work really shines is in the juxtaposition of the other photographs of similar subjects, you'll be seeing this throughout their works

## Water Towers
Most of their work is taken in black and white and I think this was a great creative decision as the lack of color allows you to focus on the shapes and lines of the structure. the blank white skies also help in this making sure that most of the dark colors are coming from the subject keeping you focused there as well.

## Blast furnaces


## Chemical Factories
I think this works evoke an almost nostalgic feeling. The emptiness some of these photographs display with the lack of color and people and expression

## Grain elevators
