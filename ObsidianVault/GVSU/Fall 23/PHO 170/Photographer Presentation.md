## Intro
Bernd and Hilla Becher were a couple from Germany who started with a very specific style and stuck with it for their active time in photography from 1959 to 2007. One unique aspect of their work was the use of large format film cameras. These cameras were able to capture immense depths of detail in the architectural design of abandoned industrial structures.

## German Homes
Some of their early works focused on the architecture of German homes, showcasing the collection of straight lines that make up the walls of the house.

Where their work really stands out is in the juxtaposition of the other photographs of similar subjects, you'll be seeing this throughout their works

## Water Towers
Most of their work is taken in black and white and I think this was a great creative decision as the lack of color allows you to focus on the shapes and lines of the structure. the blank white skies also help in this making sure that most of the dark colors are coming from the subject keeping you focused there as well.

## Blast furnaces
One of their goals as photographers was to capture the form of these industrial structures in These blast furnace photos do a great job at isolating

> We want to change nothing about the objects we photograph, and it is a principle to which we adhere today. Only one artifice is always permissible, namely to strip the individual objects of context, in other words to position them in such a way that they fill the frame; now this does not concur with the facts, as on site they are still usually in the midst of an architectural chaos or jungle. But this artifice is necessary in order to gain an inclusive view of them as an overall form. 

## Chemical Factories
These chemical factories are some of my favorite from the two. The first look at this structure seems like a chaotic mess of metal but the longer you look you realize that the steel has order to it think this works evoke an almost nostalgic feeling. The emptiness some of these photographs display with the lack of color and people and expression
