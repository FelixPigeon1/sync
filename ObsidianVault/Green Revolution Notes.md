why should the green revolution should be given a spot on the technological history?
The way in which we grow food has had a major impact
significant development in the last 60 years
Norman Borlaug (1914 - 2009)
PhD in plant biology
Worked for Norman Rockefeller foundation cooperative Mexican agricultural program in mexico
developed "dwarf" wheat strain that dramatically increased productivity
The successes of industrial technology, medical technology, and green revolution has brought on huge population growth for humans
Norman was focused on helping hunger issues as he had lived through the great depression
Started with being not very interested in genomics
Shuttle breeding - utilized two environmental locations to get 2 seasons of a growing yield in a second season
Winter cycle lower elevation summer cycle higher elevation
impact was you could now quickly grow more wheat
led to a grain that could survive a large variety of environmental conditions 
no longer need to make different types of wheat for different locations
dwarf wheat does not have to grow as tall to be harvest-able4
IR8 - A dwarf rice, similar benefits as dwarf wheat
1960s during the cold war, space race, and other political

>These and other developments in the field of agriculture contain the makings of a new revolution. It is not a violet red revolution like that of the soviets, nor is it a white revolution like that of the Shah of Iran. I call it the Green Revolution

People wouldn't revolt if their bellies are full
Didn't just feed people, but also pushed the US agenda

changed agriculture by including pesticides, seen by some as dangerous for consumption. People don't like potentially dangerous chemicals in their food
