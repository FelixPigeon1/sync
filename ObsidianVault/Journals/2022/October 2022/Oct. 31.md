I have not done a journal entry like this since back in march of this year. So much for the promise of doing this regularly. I got the inspiration to do this again after brainstorming ideas for my project 3 paper for writing. This app makes it pretty easy to just type worry free. I also took the time to link it through google drive so I can add to this at my desktop or laptop. Trying to set it up on my phone or ipad will be a little more tedious since I would have to manually download the files if I wanted to edit them and then reupload them. I don't think this is a massive issue anyway since it is way more enjoyable to type on a actual keyboard than a screen keyboard.

Right now I'm sitting in the lab of my CIS 162 lab at henry hall, the professor is explaining the lab in a monotone voice and I am not really paying attention. From the bits and pieces I've heard this lab sounds pretty easy, which is good cause I need to get out of here ASAP because I have yet to eat today and it is already 4 o'clock. I had a double shot starbucks drink at like 12 and that was it. Frankly its hard to focus on anything but food at the moment but I'm going to have to really buckle down so that I can eat something. Maybe burgers at kliner? I'm always down for a burger.
