Here we are again, been a real hot minute since my last entry but there wasn't really a necessity for it so I guess its fine.

After all I really only do this when I have a lot of thoughts going around in my head. It is rather nice to do this once in a while but I think I say this every time.

Where to begin, I guess with classes. Today it finally hit me that I have a lot on my plate to get done between now and next monday, this is not going to be a fun week for me. Cs project, cs lab, speech, all on top of eachother. I still have not started either project. Speech I don't think will be that bad, I don't have to do a lot of research and I'll actually have notecards this time so that should help calm my nerves about it. I think I have been overreacting about my deadlines, I still have 5-6 days to get everything done including the weekend. Depending on what day I go for my speech I could have even more time to practice and polish it out should that be necessary. 

now for the bigger thing that has been on my mind recently, a bit of a identiy crisis or something like that. I don't really know what it is right now still working it out. Most of it is driven by wanting to improve myself,

taking better care of my hair is one. I think I need to get it cut but to be honest im scared to death that it's gonna get fucked up. It's so hard to find a good stylist that will listen to me when I want to keep the length.

Basically I want to change my entire outward appearance, clothes, hair hopefully weight, I am not satisfied with how I look right now. It's hard trying to shop for clothes because it is hard to tell if what I buy would look good on a bigger person. But it will take so long for me to lose enough weight for me to fit into the smaller clothes. I really just need to go to the gym but it scares me to go there, too afraid of being judged, too afraid of just being the "fat guy" in there. 

that's another thing, I'm not great socially. I'm terrible at making friends it just takes me a while because I hate surface level shit. A friend for me has to be someone that actually does stuff with me and have meaningful converstations. Nyla is ok but idk our interests don't really align? idk she like some nerdy shit but at the same time it seems like I think poser is the word? that sounds so fucking cheesey oh my god that was horrible. moving on.

I do want to have a girlfriend it sounds like it would be really nice to have that someone in my life who truely loves me, aside from my mom, but it ties back into my lack of social skills. Any dating app seems horrible and not genuine but I might be forced to go that route because idk how to find people on campus or rather what is the appropiate time to like get to know them. I see girls I think are cute but it's usually in the dining hall and I cannot imagine a way to approach them without it being incredibly akward. To me, they just don't want to be bothered which seems fair, I wouldn't want to be bothered either.

maybe I should just go on tinder or something but I feel like it's mostly for hookups and not actual relationships which is what I want. Maybe id have better luck on hinge or bumble idk.
